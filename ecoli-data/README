Those files were downloaded from the Ensembl genomes website.

Each file corresponds to one Escherichia coli strain for which a
complete or draft genome sequence is available. The name of the strain
is contained in the file name. Each file contains the peptide
sequences from all translations resulting from Ensembl known or novel
gene predictions for that given E. coli strain.

Files are in the FASTA format.
